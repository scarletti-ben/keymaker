# keymaker
This project uses the `Web Crypto API` built into `JavaScript` to generate public / private key pairs, convert the keys to `Base-64` encoded strings, and store them as a `.env` file on the user's system. All at the click of a button.

You can access the site [here](https://scarletti-ben.github.io/keymaker), or clone the repository and run it via your own local server.

> [!WARNING]
> The generation of the keys should be secure but make sure that you are careful with the contents of the `.env` file, never expose the contents publicly under any circumstances
